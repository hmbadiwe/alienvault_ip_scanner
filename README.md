Ip Address Range Application

This project uses maven (>= 3.0) and Java (>= 1.6)

It provides a UI for interacting with the app.
Please use small ranges of about 1000 entries ( I haven't fully worked out the paging :-) )

I admit, it's still a work in progress albeit, a bit usable.

To run the UI:
from the application root, run "mvn jetty:run".
In your browser, go to "localhost:9000".
If 9000 is not a suitable port, on line 58 of the POM, you can change the port value to whatever you desire.

Thanks.
